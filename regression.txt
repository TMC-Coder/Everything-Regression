Hi GitHub!

This is my first repo and I'm a traveling high school teacher who instructs learners and community members on various topics. For example, I spend a significant amount of time discussiong regression analysis.

I visit numerous states in the U.S. and countries around the world where I frequently adapt my regression analysis to relate the anlaysis on issues that impact the local community (e.g., Arizona drop out rates in high school. Then present the findings to local community members, parents and students).
I'm constantly having to subsititute variables names in my analysis and modifying my language (slightly) to acccurately describe the analysis to the respective community.

My objective of this repository is to either point me to an existing (r) package and/or create a new (r) package that essentially describes the analysis for me once I run my code in R Studio with its respective data.

For Example: "Describe Regression Package" - The (X) Predictor Variable has 12% of unique variance that accounts for (Y) variable...

The following items are what I'm hoping to describe during my analysis and it's value;

1) Correlation (Strength)
2) Bivariate Regression
3) Confidence Band
4) Regression Bootstrap
5) Sum of Residuals
6) Residual Plot
7) Scatter Plot (Shape)
8) Partition Mean Difference
9) Regression Bootstrap
10) R2
11) Adjusted R2
12) Checking Assumptions - Homogeneity of Variance, Distributions
13) T-Test
14) One and Two-Sample T-Test
15) Variance of Fitted Values & Residuals
16) Interactions, Semi & Partial
17) Multiple Regression
18) F Statistic
19) Prediction Intervals
20) Multicollinearity

*I only have about a week of experience with r and Rstudio. If I'm missing anything or have feedback, I welcome the opportunity to learn more!

Thanks in advance!
